Porque, se for para pegar dados de um banco que eu nem tenho permissão de edição, jogar no Python e depois subir para outro banco ou planilha… isso realmente compensa?\n\nTambém fico perdida porque vejo opiniões muito diferentes: tem gente que fala que Power BI é maravilhoso, outros dizem que o certo é fazer todos os gráficos no Python e que BI é ruim… e eu sinceramente não sei por onde começar nem no que focar para evoluir.\n\nOutro ponto: temos um banco em que o pessoal do TI cadastra nomes de empresas e outras informações de formas diferentes. A gente trata isso nos dashboards, mas sempre aparece uma nova variação e temos que corrigir tudo de novo. Se levássemos esse tratamento para Python, não seria o mesmo problema? Como garantir que os dados fiquem padronizados e corretos ao longo do tempo?\n\nE ainda surgem outras dúvidas:  \nonde guardar os códigos?  \ncomo organizar os projetos?  \ncomo lidar com erros?  \nquestões de segurança?\n\nO Python é tão abrangente que acabo não sabendo em que focar primeiro.\n\nSe alguém puder compartilhar como funciona esse fluxo na prática (Python + banco + BI) e o que realmente vale a pena estudar no início, eu agradeceria muito!", "author": "Then-Arrival-9464", "permalink": "/r/dataengineering/comments/1r19lmd/power_bi_x_python/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1r19lmd/power_bi_x_python/", "score": 0, "num_comments": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.18, "over_18": false}
