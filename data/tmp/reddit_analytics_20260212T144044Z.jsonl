Over the last year, I picked up Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau and did various projects for my nonprofit organization involving each one of those tools, especially Python. I built a portfolio for my project and applied to a number of online MSDS programs (since I’m currently living overseas) and managed to get accepted to all of them, namely UCSD &amp; Purdue. However, now I’m very much considering applying to an M.S. in applied stats.\n\nI completed an online Coursera certificate in Probability &amp; Statistics for Machine Learning course during my application period, and it reminded me of why I chose to do math for my undergraduate. I was originally Astronomy but I always felt the desire to understand the math behind what I was learning more deeply and concretely. Now I feel the same way about data science. I love machine learning concepts, programming, etc., but I want to understand those models at a deep mathematical level beyond what most data scientists typically do. So that makes me want to pursue an M.S. in applied stats. But I’m torn!
